He's put together lots of information in the apartment about great local restaurants around the docks and there is loads of detail about Antwerp as a whole.\n\nThe apartment is exactly as wonderful as the photography on the Airbnb site. It's a good big size with lot's of light through the floor to ceiling windows.\n\nBoth bedrooms are gorgeous with super comfortable beds and all the furniture and fittings are very cool with everything you could want for a short or longer stay.\n\nThe apartment is in a great location in the regenerated docklands area around the MAS museum - which is only 2 min walk away. It's only 10-15 min walk into the old quarter of Antwerp and we were actually in the Zuid area (Contemporary & Fine Art museums etc.) within a 30 min walk - all very easy. The apartment is only a 5 min taxi ride from the Centraal station too.\n\nVery highly recommended apartment & host - book with confidence!",

Deze is zeer ruim, schoon en met voldoende privacy voor een ieder vanwege de twee badkamers en gescheiden toiletten. Het is prettig dat er ruim voldoende badhanddoeken aanwezig zijn. Indien nodig kan de wasmachine zelfs gebruikt worden! De ligging is perfect. Vanaf de snelweg is het zeer makkelijk te bereiken en het hebben van een plek in de parkeergarage is super. Het is een rustige buurt, met toch ook veel gezelligheid en centraal gelegen. Dicht bij twee musea, tal van restaurants, op slechts 15 minuten loopafstand van het oude centrum. Paul Zeguers is zeer gastvrij, heeft ons rustig en duidelijk alles over het appartement en omgeving uitgelegd. Een pluspunt is dat je tegen een zeer geringe vergoeding gebruik kan maken van onder andere Nespressocups, wijn, bier, en frisdrank: handig als je iets vergeten bent en de winkels zijn dicht. Wij kunnen dit appartement aan iedereen aanbevelen.",

I felt completely at ease immediately. The apartment was perfect for exploring Antwerp with perhaps a ten minute walk into the centre of town. But if you don't wish to go into town there are plenty of bars, restaurants, cafe's bakeries within a very short walk of the apartment. The views from the apartment make it feel pretty special, even at night but when the curtains are drawn you have your privacy. The major boon with this apartment is the car parking. Parking a car in Antwerp is a trial sometimes but here no. Underground, very secure parking with access into the apartment block. A lot of Airbnb apartments are lived in by their owners which of course is mostly the point with this service. I do however prefer 'Pure Lets' without all the personal items of the owners surrounding you. This apartment is purely let for guests so no clothing in the wardrobes etc. A great place to stay with a decent road network in and out to the apartment too. Perfect.",

The location is great at the north end of the city centre, easy to find and has a variety of artisan shops and galleries on the doorstep with a very handy mini-market right downstairs.\n\nThe flat immediately impresses with views, and the security of the entrance. The lift is small but can still fit 2 people & suitcases. \n\nThe decor is neutral and spotlessly kept, in fact the whole flat was immaculate, with quality furniture throughout.\n\nThe listing could really do with a layout to really sell it. The living space and 2 bedrooms are far enough apart that noise isn't an issue. There is a useful office space. The 2 balconies are a useful addition to the space. Our party was 2 couples and we did not feel cramped or as if we were tripping over each other.\n\nThe kitchen is extensively kitted out with everything you need to either eat on the fly or host a diner party. The large fridge meant that we only had to shop once for our stay leaving us all the sightseeing time to enjoy.\n",

Zijn uitleg over het gebruik van het appartement was helder en kernachtig. Ook waren de bijzonderheden goed gedocumenteerd. Bij de documentatie behoorde ook een uitleg over de directe omgeving van het appartement.\n\nHet appartement is ruim van maat en zo ook de afzonderlijke ruimten. Direct valt het op dat alles kraakhelder en schoon is. Badkamers en toiletten hygihellonisch en blinkend schoon, royaal voorzien van handdoeken. Mooie beddenbedekking en zalige bedden. Keuken is compleet en fijn dat er een vaatwasser en Nespressomachine was met een assortiment koffiecupjes. Je bereikt het appartement per lift. Betaald parkeren belast niet gezien de ruime plek in de garage.\n\nAangenaam zijn de twee balkons. Die aan de woonkamer vangt de ochtendzon en die aan de werktafel de namiddagzon. De isolatie is perfect: bij gesloten schuifdeuren is het prettig stil. Direct naast de ingang is er een kleine maar goed gevulde supermarkt en heel dicht bij een superbakker met heerlijk brood. We hebben daar fijn ontbeten. Restaurants alom en het stadshart is op 2 kilometer.\n\nIk zal het appartement zeker aanbevelen bij vrienden die Antwerpen willen aandoen en voor onszelf houden we het adres en telefoonnummer van Paul bij de hand.",

Een goed Nespresso apparaat helpt bij het wakker worden. Zo ook de meer dan  lekkere douche. Het aparte bad (in badkamer 1) is ook veelvuldig gebruikt. Wij hebben Paul als gastheer getroffen en voelden ons meteen thuis. Voor extra vragen of wensen is Paul altijd bereikbaar en behulpzaam om te helpen. \nVlakbij is een meesterbakker gevestigd waar je goed kan ontbijten. En voor lunch of diner is er in de directe omgeving erg veel keus uit zeer goede restaurants. Voor een goede kop koffie kan je aan de overkant terecht. De stad is snel te bereiken met Velo Antwerp, een soort witte fietsen systeem. Echt geweldig. \nKortom, houdt je van modern en een hippe uitdagende wijk? Dan moet je hier zijn! Maar niet allemaal, wij willen namelijk wel vaker gaan.",

Paul and Gina have arranged things to run very smoothly, and the nice touches--like a gift card for the ice cream shop across the street!--made us feel welcome and relaxed.  The guest book is full of excellent suggestions; we particularly liked La pipe d'Anvers which serves delicious traditional food in a warm, neighborhood atmosphere.

We were 4 adults and one 2 year old and we fit fine in the apartment even if it is not that big. The shower was a bit tricky but nothing bad. The kitchen is actually quite large. The apartment was perfectly clean.\n\nWe really liked that the heater is a gas stove in the living room which gave a nice atmosphere to the apartment. \n\nMiertje was very friendly and helpful and we are especially grateful for the flexible check-out time! \n\nThe only thing that bothered my husband a bit was noise in the evening and noise from the cafe...the building is old and the walls thin - you can hear people going up the stairs and the music that is played in the cafe downstairs (very softly). The cafe closes early (8pm) so that really is not a bother but I guess we were just unlucky as there was music until very late both Friday and Saturday nights coming from somewhere else... Me and my 2-year old slept right through it but my husband found it annoying. \n\nStill, overall, I would recommend the apartment to any of my friends and I would gladly stay there myself again too.

We love coffee, quaint living rooms and playing Scrabble. We LOVE being centrally located, and not have to take a bus or subway to get to the quaint and historic. If THIS resonates with you, then Miertje's property is for you! There isn't much to complain about, and there's MUCH to praise! The bottom line is that we had a great time and have no regrets! We were in a quiet apartment, with loads of natural light, in the heart of historic Antwerp, surrounded by coffee shops, Museums, historic squares and interesting shops.  I'll start with whatever I can think of that fell short a bit: 1) The apt. is one just flight up from the street, but the steps are steep and narrow. This cuts both ways, actually. If you want the Building Code of 21st Century America, don't bother going to Europe altogether - particularly the historic districts! This wasn't a deal breaker by any stretch, but be ready to take your luggage up one piece at a time (advice: travel light!) 2) Could Miertje invest in the shower, and make it a bit more luxurious, instead of just average? I don't exactly know what her expense overhead is, but I guess she could. 3) I wish it was just a bit cheaper to rent in late January, but that's Europe, there ARE heating expenses, and it's a competitive marketplace! More than that, I can't think of anything even questionably bad to say! The apartment was 100% clean. There were a good 20-30 new towels. No laundry, but we didn't need any. The kitchen was fine, with loads of things that made life easier (utensils, coffee, salt, pepper, etc). A mixture of antiques and IKEA, everything was just right for a couple looking for a romantic weekend in historic Belgium. We got to know Miertje a bit when we arrived at around 20:30 pm. Miertje is an artsy, creative person who lived in the US for a few years in the '80s. She's a pleasant, happy humanist, with obviously great EQ. She was not in our hair, we didn't see her again, and she even let us \"check out\" by ourselves at 7 AM, simply by leaving the keys in the apartment and pulling shut the door from the street! Miertje lives in a different neighborhood, so we weren't running into her A gruff landlord can ruin a mood, and we didn't have that experience!\nIn short, if you want elevators, the hum of vacuums and room service - check into a Marriott! If you want an authentic historic \"local\" experience in Antwerp - this is The Genuine Article! I'D DO IT AGAIN, EXACTLY THE SAME WAY!",

Het is een rustige buurt, maar tegelijkertijd ben je midden in het centrum. We zijn 3 dagen gebleven en hebben alles te voet gedaan:  zonder moe te zijn aan het eind van de dag. \nKristien zelf was snel met reageren op berichten die ik heb gestuurd, ook tijdens mijn verblijf.

When you stay here, you feel like you're a part of the community. Plus, it was extremely clean, something I'll admit I was a little surprised at. I would expect an apartment of this age to be a little dirty but it truly was incredibly clean. \n\nThe bed was comfy, the pillows fluffy, and the Aesop products aren't just for the photoshellothey're actually there IRL for you to use.\n\nThe *only* thing I would suggest being aware of is that the little square where it's located can get a touch noisy on a Friday morning or on Saturday nights. As the square is a community gathering space, it's completely understandable and 100% did not impact my enjoyment of the space. But if you are someone who is sensitive to noise, it may bother you. \n\nLast thing: My absolute favourite part of the whole experience was sitting at the little cafe downstairs for a glass of wine and a little snack.  I'll be telling anyone I know that's going to Antwerp to look up Kristien's apartment. If you stay here, you won't be disappointed.",

Ze heeft zelfs nog een extra nachtje voor ons geregeld.\n\nEen aanrader!\n\nGroet,\nMaarten",

There are two small elevators (the apartment is on the 7th floor) and a washer but no dryer (a clothes drying rack is provided - we found that it took 2 or 3 days for clothes and towels to dry). The kitchen is well-equipped with everything you need, and the bathroom facilities include a separate toilet-room in the entry hall. There's a nice, deep bathtub which was great for soaking in after a long days of walking around. The separate shower tends to send water all over the bathroom floor - we found that it helped to remove the grate from over the drain to help it more easily catch all the runoff. The train station is a bit of a walk (15 to 20 minutes depending on pace) and we thought the major tourist areas like the Grote Markt are more of a \"take a cab\" distance than a walking one, but we were there in winter when the weather didn't make walking very appealing. Taking the train to Brussels, Ghent and Amsterdam were fun and easy. Antwerp is a great home base for exploring the area, and this apartment is a great place to come home to.",

She was quick to reply and very accomodating.\nDue to a miscommunication we were a little late to pick up the keys, but Marleen was very understanding. She made my parents feel at home immediately and even gave them some home-made jam!\nThe apartment itself is spacious, comfortable, nicely decorated and clean. My parents stayed for three nights and enjoyed it very much. They slept really wel: it is a quiet neighbourhood and at night there is no noise from outside. As for the location, I can testify for myself (I live closeby) that is perfect to discover Antwerp. Either by bike, by foot or by public transport. Moreover, there are some nice cafhellos, restaurants, (grocery)shops and parks nearby. \n\nMy parents told me that when they will be back to visit me, they would love to stay at Marleen's again!",

It's easy to get to town from their apartment - a short bike ride (on the bike they kindly lent me) or 10-12 minute walk to Antwerp Central station, or the No.10 tram. Fronk & Lieve shared stories with me about Antwerp's history which made my visit to the city a much richer experience, and made some great recommendations on things to see and places to eat.

This woman would do anything to make sure you had a lovely stay in Antwerp; I felt so lucky to encounter such a generous and caring host - she really made my trip special. \n\nStaying with Leyes was an absolute pleasure!

Leyes very generously offered breakfast and we had a very interesting and thoughtful discussion about the current state of Belgian politics - it was definitely a highlight of my trip.

He told me before the reservation that the room I selected is not available, but they can offer me another room in the building on the same comfort level. Unfortunately I didn't get any pictures about the offered room before the reservation, but I reserved the room.\n\nI wrote the time of my arrival in advance. Finding of the place wasn't a problem, it's quite near to the Central Station. The neighborhood is not the best of Antwerp but it's okay for the price. There are a lot of public transport opportunities on the street of the place that was useful for me. \n\nLieve was at home at the time of my arrival. She introduced me to Elena. Elena was the owner of the offered room. She gave me the keys to the flat, told me the basic instructions and showed the room. I saw immediately that the level of the room is not the same as on the photos of my booked room. The room was full of the things of Elena's son (helmets, toy weapons, etc), console game posters on the wall, etc. The room wasn't clean, the reason of this could be Elena's dog. I didn't refused the room, because I didn't want to look after an other one, but if I were in the same situation again, probably I would try. That time I didn't know but during the night I realized that the mattress of the bed is too soft and really uncomfortable, I woke up many times because of this. The wifi didn't work permanently in the room, as Elena said when I arrived. So the room wasn't good. The bathroom was okay.\n\nElena was nice as well.\n\nIt's a pity that my first occasion with Airbnb was quite bad.",

            "context": "I recently stayed with them for 5 weeks. The reason I picked there place was: (1) it was located close to the Antwerp train Station, (2) it was the cheapest/or close to it on Airbnb, (3) the good reviews\n\nPROS: \n(1) It is about a 10 minute walk to the Antwerp Train Station. Basically all you do, is get out of their apartment, walk left, and your there. If you keep walking for another 20 minutes, you will be in the heart of Antwerp where all the tourist are. Their neighborhood is in a heavily Moroccan/Turkish part of town. I was ok with it, but some might not be. \n(2) Lieve the wife is an absolute sweet heart. She will give you a map of the city, and while I was there, she would randomly ask how I was doing, and how my day was. She is really sweet + kind. I did not have much conversation with the husband (fronk). \n(3) they are always home! So no matter what time you get to town, you can probably locate them easily. \n\nCONS: \n(1) The Airbnb advertisement is not correct. They live in a small 3 bedroom apartment. In which, they rent out ALL THREE ROOMS to different people!! Thus their is always people coming and going. Usually both rooms are booked, and they sleep in the 3rd room. However when all 3 are booked, they sleep in the living room. (if I knew they rent out all 3 rooms to different people, i would have never stayed here).  \n(2) CLEANLINESS (Huge Problem): They have 2 bathrooms. Their first bathroom has a functioning toilet. The second bathroom has a non-functioning toilet and a shower. Thus all the guest, and the hosts, use the first bathroom (when they have to use the toilet). Whenever I would use the bathroom I would clean the toilet seat with rubbing alcohol, because I found on numerous occasions it to be disgustingly dirty (feces and urine staines). Im not sure if this was from the other guests or the husband. Furthermore, every time you take a shower you have to take out the shower plug, remove the peoples hairs, and then take your shower. There is actually written instruction on the shower how to do this. Thus bring plastic gloves with you! Again, coming from the US, I found this disgusting. Not sure if its a common thing in Europe. In general, the bathroom, shower, and kitchen were not the cleanest as they could be. And sometimes absolutely disgusting. \n\nALL IN ALL: if you stay for 1-2 nights its an ok choice (specially given if you don't want to cook, or spend long durations in the apartment). It will get the job done, and you probably won't experience the lack of cleanliness. However if you stay for longer, I strongly suggest you finding another place. OR just renting an apartment month-to-month (for about $600 Euros a month...something that I later learned). ",
